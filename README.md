# üåø Pathogen Classification

This project involves a machine learning model that classifies leaves based on their health status. The model predicts whether a leaf is infected by bacteria, fungi, pests, or viruses, or if it is healthy. The model is trained using **TensorFlow** and optimized with **Keras Tuner** to find the best parameters. A **Flask API** is used to serve the model, while a **React frontend** allows users to upload leaf images and visualize the classification results with a probability bar chart.

## üíº Situation

I was contracted by an agri-tech company that provides digital tools for farmers, aiming to reduce the reliance on manual diagnosis and speed up disease detection in crops. The company wanted a solution to help farmers‚Äîespecially those in remote areas‚Äîquickly identify plant diseases from leaf images. The objective was to develop a simple, fast, and accessible tool for disease classification, offering real-time predictions with a user-friendly interface.

The problem: Manual diagnosis of plant diseases is time-consuming and requires expertise that is not always available in remote areas.

The solution: I developed a tool that automates the classification of plant diseases using a machine learning model, which can be easily accessed and used by farmers to quickly identify the health of their crops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras Tuner (for hyperparameter optimization)
- **Backend**: Flask (to serve the model and handle image uploads)
- **Frontend**: React (to create a user interface for image upload and result display)
- **Testing**: Postman (for API testing), pytest (for backend unit tests)
- **Version Control**: Git (for code management)

## üîë Key Features

- üì∏ **Upload Leaf Images**: Users can upload an image of a leaf for classification.
- üìä **Classification Results**: View the classification results as a bar chart, showing the probability of the leaf belonging to each disease category (bacteria, fungi, pests, virus, or healthy).
- ‚ö° **Fast Predictions**: Real-time predictions are made using a trained machine learning model.
- üîí **API Testing**: The API is tested using Postman for proper functionality, and unit tests are written with pytest.

## üìà Model Summary

The model architecture consists of several layers, including rescaling, flattening, and dense layers. Here‚Äôs an overview:

| Layer (type)       | Output Shape         | Param #       |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| rescaling (Rescaling) | (None, 256, 256, 3) | 0            |
| flatten (Flatten)  | (None, 196608)       | 0            |
| dense (Dense)      | (None, 73)           | 14,352,457   |
| dense_1 (Dense)    | (None, 73)           | 5,402        |
| dense_2 (Dense)    | (None, 5)            | 370          |
